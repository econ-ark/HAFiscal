<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >This section describes how we set the model’s parameters. First, we estimate the extent to
which consumers ‘splurge’ when receiving an income shock. Given the lack of empirical
evidence of the marginal propensity to consume over time for the US, we use instead
Norwegian data to estimate the splurge. Speciﬁcally, we calibrate our model to the
Norwegian economy and match evidence from Norway on the proﬁle of the marginal
propensity to spend over time and across diﬀerent wealth levels, as provided by
<span 
class="ecbx-1200">?</span>.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="Parameterization2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1001f1"></a>  
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  Second, we set up the full model on U.S. data, taking the splurge factor as given from the
Norwegian estimation In the full model, agents diﬀer according to their level of education
and their subjective discount factors. A subset of the parameters in the model are
calibrated equally for all types, and some parameters are calibrated to be speciﬁc to each
education group. Finally, a distribution of subjective discount factors is estimated
separately for each education group to match features of each within-group liquid wealth
distribution.

<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >The splurge allows us to capture the shorter- and longer-term response of consumption to
income shocks, especially for consumers with signiﬁcant liquid wealth. The main aim of this
paper, however, is to rank consumption stimulus policies, not to provide a microfoundation for
the splurging behavior. We view the splurge factor as a model device that enables us to rank
the policies in a model that is consistent with the best available micro-evidence of
spending patterns over time after a transitory income shock. In appendix <span 
class="ecbx-1200">??</span> we provide
results from our model without a splurge factor. There we show that such a model
provides a worse ﬁt to the moments in the data that we are interested in, but not
dramatically so, and that our conclusions regarding the ranking of the policies are not
aﬀected.
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >  The speciﬁc exercise we carry out in this section, is to show that our model can account well
for the results of <span 
class="ecbx-1200">?</span>, who study the eﬀect of lottery winnings in Norway on consumption using
millions of records from the Norwegian population registry. We calibrate our model to reﬂect
the Norwegian economy and, using their results, estimate the splurge factor, as well
as the distribution of discount factors in the population, to match two empirical
moments.
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >  First, we take from <span 
class="ecbx-1200">? </span>the marginal propensity to consume out of a one-period income shock.
We target not only the initial (aggregate) response of consumption to the income shock, but
also the subsequent eﬀect on consumption in years one through four after the shock. We also
target the initial consumption response in the cross-section, i.e. across the quartiles of the
liquid wealth distribution, for which empirical estimates are also provided. The shares of
lottery winnings expended at diﬀerent time horizons, as found in <span 
class="ecbx-1200">?</span>, are plotted in ﬁgure <span 
class="ecbx-1200">??</span>.
Table <span 
class="ecbx-1200">??</span> (second row) shows the initial consumption response across liquid wealth
quartiles.
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >  Second, we match the steady-state distribution of liquid wealth in the
model to its empirical counterpart. Because of the lack of data on the liquid
wealth distribution in Norway, we use the corresponding data from the United
States, assuming that liquid wealth inequality is comparable across these
countries.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

population at the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th income percentiles, which, in data from the
Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) in 2004 (see section <span

<!--l. 123--><p class="noindent" >Before we move on to the parameterization of the full model, we describe in detail the data
that we use to get measures of permanent income, liquid wealth, and the division of
households into educational groups in the United States. We use data on the distribution of
liquid wealth from the 2004 wave of the SCF. We restrict our attention to households where
the head is of working age, which we deﬁne to be in the range from 25 to 62. The SCF-variable
“normal annual income” is our measure of the household’s permanent income, and, to exclude
outliers, we drop the observations that make up the bottom 5 percent of the distribution of
this variable. The smallest value of permanent income for households in our sample is thus
$16,708.

debt, which is the revolving debt on credit card balances. Note that the SCF does
not contain information on cash holdings, so these are imputed with the procedure
described in Appendix B.1 of <span

considered part of liquid debt. We drop any households that have negative liquid
wealth.

without obtaining a bachelor’s degree; and the third group, “College,” consists of
heads of households who have obtained a bachelor’s degree or higher. With this

<!--l. 291--><p class="noindent" >Before we move on to compare diﬀerent consumption stimulus policies in the calibrated model,
we also report implications of the model for some non-targeted moments. Panel A of table <span 
class="ecbx-1200">??</span>
shows the wealth distribution across the three education groups in the data and in the model.
The model matches these shares quite closely, which may not be surprising given that we
calibrate the size of each group and we manage to ﬁt the wealth distribution within each
group separately. The panel also reports the average marginal propensity to consume for the
diﬀerent groups. To be comparable to numbers reported in <span 
class="ecbx-1200">?</span>, these are calculated as the
average MPC in the year of a lottery win. Lottery wins occur in a random quarter of the year
that diﬀers across individuals. The MPC for an individual depends on the spending
pattern after the win, and these are averaged across individuals within each education
group.
<!--l. 293--><p class="indent" >  Panel B of table <span 
class="ecbx-1200">??</span> shows similar numbers to Panel A, sorted by quartiles of the liquid
wealth distribution instead of education groups. Our model yields a slightly more
concentrated liquid wealth distribution than in the data. However, it does produce a
fairly high MPC even for households in the highest quartile of the liquid wealth
distribution. This is consistent with the results found in the Norwegian data by
<span 
class="ecbx-1200">?</span>, but also with recent results in <span 
class="ecbx-1200">?</span>. In an administrative dataset from a large US
ﬁnancial institution, they ﬁnd that the spending response to an income receipt is large
across the distribution of liquid asset holdings. In our model, we obtain this result
due to the inclusion of the splurge factor. As shown in Appendix <span 
class="ecbx-1200">??</span>, the model is
not able to generate a high MPC for the highest wealth quartile without splurge
consumption.

<!--l. 350--><p class="indent" >  Finally, we consider the implications of our model for two diﬀerent patterns of spending over
time. The ﬁrst pattern is the dynamics of spending after a lottery win from <span 
class="ecbx-1200">?</span>. This pattern
was used in the estimation of the splurge factor in section <span 
class="ecbx-1200">??</span>, but was not targeted when
estimating the discount factor distributions for each education group in section <span 
class="ecbx-1200">??</span>. Figure <span 
class="ecbx-1200">??</span>
shows that the model that is estimated taking the value of the splurge as given, results in a
distribution of spending over time that is very similar to the one found in the Norwegian
data.
<!--l. 352--><p class="indent" >  The second pattern concerns the dynamics of income and spending for households
that become unemployed and remain unemployed long enough for unemployment
beneﬁts to expire. Figure <span 
class="ecbx-1200">??</span> shows the pattern of income and spending for such
households. <span 
class="ecbx-1200">? </span>report the empirical result that nondurable spending drops by 12
percent the month when beneﬁts expire. Our quarterly model is broadly consistent
with this, and the drop in spending the quarter after the expiry of UI beneﬁts is 18
percent.
