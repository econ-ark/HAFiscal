<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >The main results of this paper are presented in a partial equilibrium setup with
aggregate demand eﬀects that do not arise from general equilibrium eﬀects. We
think there are many advantages to studying the welfare and multiplier eﬀects in
this setting without embedding the model in general equilibrium. First, general
equilibrium models often struggle to adequately capture the feedback mechanisms between
consumption and income, particularly the asymmetric nature of these relationships
during recessionary versus expansionary periods. Additionally, a complete general
equilibrium treatment would necessitate the analysis of numerous complex channels
including investment dynamics, ﬁrm ownership structures and dividend distribution
policies, inventory management, and international trade ﬂows—elements that, while
important in their own right, would potentially obscure the core mechanisms we aim to
investigate.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >  Despite the advantages of our partial equilibrium approach, here we complement
our analysis with a general equilibrium HANK and SAM model, as standard as
possible, that is able to capture supply-side eﬀects that are absent from the partial
equilibrium model. In particular, ﬁscal policies can generate labor market responses that
our partial equilibrium analysis does not address. These supply-side channels can
aﬀect both the welfare implications and the ﬁscal multipliers of diﬀerent policy
interventions.
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >  We embed the consumption choices of our households—–with heterogeneity over education type
and discount factors—–in a New Keynesian model with search and matching. Aside from the
consumption block of the model, the framework closely follows <span 
class="ecbx-1200">?</span>, with complete details provided in
appendix <span 
class="ecbx-1200">??</span>.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HANK2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a

The general equilibrium structure generates ﬁscal multipliers through an intertemporal
Keynesian cross mechanism, which becomes particularly pronounced when monetary policy is
passive. Moreover, the search and matching framework allows the employment rate to respond
to policy interventions, allowing us to capture both demand and supply eﬀects of ﬁscal
policies.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >  Our approach in this section relies on linearizing the macro dynamics of the model and
employs the Sequence Space Jacobian methods developed by <span 
class="ecbx-1200">?</span>. This linearization imposes
certain constraints on our analysis. Notably, we cannot evaluate the eﬀects of diﬀerent policies
starting from a deep recessionary state, as we do in our main results. This limitation prevents
us from conducting welfare comparisons between recessionary periods and the steady
state. Additionally, the Keynesian cross mechanism embedded in the model exhibits
uniform behavior regardless of the degree of economic slack—–a feature that stands
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
in contrast to the state-dependent multipliers we apply in our partial equilibrium
analysis.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >  The consumption response in this general equilibrium model to each of the three
policies is shown in Figure <span 
class="ecbx-1200">??</span>. For each of the three ﬁscal policies, we have shown the
consumption response under three diﬀerent monetary policy rules: 1) an active Taylor rule
with a coeﬃcient of 1.5 on inﬂation; 2) a ﬁxed nominal rate (simulating an eﬀective
lower bound); and 3) a ﬁxed real rate (closest in spirit to our partial equilibrium
analysis).

Furthermore, although we are unable to repeat our welfare analysis under a recession in this
model, the distributional eﬀects of the policies are similar. Most importantly, the mechanism
leading to far greater welfare beneﬁts for the UI extension, namely that the newly unemployed
have high marginal utility, are robust to the supply-side eﬀects of a general equilibrium HANK
and SAM model.

<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >  Figure <span 
class="ecbx-1200">??</span> shows the consumption multipliers over diﬀerent horizons under a ﬁxed real rate
rule, alongside those in our baseline partial equilibrium model. The multipliers are bigger in
the HANK and SAM model. Nevertheless, in both models, the relative ranking of the
consumption multipliers over time horizons are similar, with the eﬀect of the tax cut
substantially smaller than the stimulus check or UI extension policies, despite the inclusion of
supply-side eﬀects in this HANK model. However, towards the end of the period shown the
tax cut consumption multiplier is near that of the stimulus check. This is because the
aggregate demand eﬀects in our partial equilibrium model do not continue beyond the
recession, dampening the beneﬁts of the tax cut policy—in which much of the extra spending
occurs after the recession is over—relative to the stimulus check and extended UI
policies.
