## Feedback on LaTeX Documents for HAFiscal (2/1/2025, 4:48:16 PM)

_**User**_

'intro.tex' and 'literature.tex' are Latex subfiles which are incorporated in building the larger document HAFiscal.pdf.  (They generate material in the introduction section of the paper).

Read HAFiscal.pdf and HAFiscal-Slides.pdf, then examine intro.tex and literature.tex carefully.  I will want your feedback on several different aspects of these latex documents.  Please start by identifying any potential typos or grammatical errors.

Below is a summary of issues and suggestions I found when reading through the text portions of the files (especially from the two subfiles, “Intro.tex” and “literature.tex”) as they appear in the larger PDF. (I did not detect any clear textual errors in the binary PDF streams of “HAFiscal.pdf” and “HAFiscal-Slides.pdf” beyond what is inherited from the LaTeX‐source.) Here are some potential typos and grammatical points to consider:

---

### In **Subfiles/Intro.tex**

1. **Typo in “splurge behavior”:**  
   The phrase  
   > “...adding to the standard model something we call ‘splurge’ **beahavior**…”  
   should be corrected to “splurge **behavior**.”

2. **Apostrophe misuse with “MPC”:**  
   In the sentence  
   > “Because the available evidence finds a high initial **MPC's** even among wealthy households…”  
   it is better to remove the apostrophe (or use the plural form) so that it reads either “a high initial MPC” (if treating it as a descriptive term) or “high initial MPCs” if you mean “marginal propensities.”

3. **Extraneous backslash in “United States”:**  
   The sentence  
   > “...in recent recessions in the United States\ (and elsewhere):…”  
   includes an unnecessary backslash. It should read as “United States (and elsewhere): …”

4. **Clarity on model naming:**  
   In the passage  
   > “...so we also analyze a standard HANK-and-SAM model GE model modified to embed our households' consumption responses.”  
   you might consider rephrasing this (for example, “...a standard HANK-and-SAM general equilibrium model…”) to avoid the somewhat repetitive “model GE model.”

5. **Phrasing/small stylistic suggestions:**  
   – The sentence beginning with “But even a brief look at the figure convinces the eye that…” is informal in tone. You might want to consider a slight rewording (e.g., “A quick inspection of the figure suggests that…”).  
   – In several places, the use of “But” at the beginning of sentences could be replaced by “However” (or combined with the previous sentence) for a more formal style.

### In **Subfiles/literature.tex**

1. **Footnote wording:**  
   In the footnote that reads  
   > “...This suggests that it might be **to fruitful** to ask respondents …”  
   the phrase “to fruitful” is awkward. A corrected version might be:  
   > “...this suggests that it might be fruitful to ask respondents why they expect to exhibit a high initial MPC.”

2. **Subject–verb agreement with “Laibson”:**  
   The sentence  
   > “\cite{laibson2022simple} **combine** these two ideas in a simple model…”  
   should be changed to “\cite{laibson2022simple} **combines** these two ideas…” if the Laibson paper is by a single author.

3. **Typo in “coccur”:**  
   In the sentence  
   > “...the ratio of initial spending on durables to the spending that would **coccur** if all spending were nondurable…”  
   “coccur” should be corrected to “occur.”

4. **Comma for clarity:**  
   In the sentence  
   > “...among others all provide strong evidence…”  
   it might be clearer to insert a comma after “among others,” so that it reads  
   > “...among others, all provide strong evidence…”

5. **General style and phrasing:**  
   – Phrases like “durables expenditures” are sometimes used; you might consider instead “expenditures on durables” or “durable goods spending” to improve clarity.  
   – In discussing papers that “present” models versus those that “build” or “develop” models, ensure that the verb tense remains consistent. For example, one might say “\cite{kaplan2014model}, who built a model …” or simply “build” if you are writing in the present tense—but consistency is key.

### Additional Notes

- **Consistency in terminology:**  
  Make sure that terms like “excess initial MPC” or “splurge consumption” are used consistently (both in spelling and punctuation) throughout the document.

- **Hyphenation:**  
  Consider “time-inconsistent” rather than “time inconsistent” if you wish to emphasize the compound adjective.

- **Overall tone:**  
  The text is largely clear and precise. There are a few informal expressions (for example, “convinces the eye”) which you might want to reconsider if a more formal tone is desired.

These are the primary typos and grammatical points I observed. Let me know if you’d like further assistance on any additional aspects (such as structure, clarity, or specific rewordings) in these LaTeX documents.
