   - No period at the end

2. Create a detailed body message that:
   - Explains the complete scope of work done during this chat
   - Lists all major changes and improvements
   - Describes the transformation from brief prompt to comprehensive specification
   - Details the GUI difftool backend emphasis work
   - Covers the file renaming and consolidation work
   - Separates major sections with blank lines

## Major Changes During This Chat

### Prompt Enhancement
- `prompts/202505250902_restore-files-where-only-timestamp-differs.md`: Transformed from 22-line .sh to 166-line comprehensive .md
- Added complete project context and available tools documentation
- Included working examples and implementation guidance
- Enhanced goal definition with 4-phase approach and success criteria

### Documentation Restructuring
- README.md: 77 lines changed (+69/-8) - Complete restructuring for GUI backend emphasis
- DEVELOPMENT.md: 23 lines changed (+18/-5) - Updated project overview and workflow
- Added "Primary Purpose: GUI Difftool Backend" sections
- Included step-by-step configuration for Beyond Compare, Meld, Kaleidoscope
- Added working examples using repository's PDF files

### File Renaming Work (from earlier in chat)
- Renamed export-test-* files to file-diff-tester-* across entire codebase
- Updated references in Python scripts, CI workflows, YAML configs
- Updated documentation files in prompts/ directory
- Removed debug output from test scripts

## Output Files
Generate and save two files in `/tmp/`:
- Short message: `/tmp/git-commit-short-msg.txt`
- Body message: `/tmp/git-commit-body-msg.txt`

(before creating the new messages, be sure to delete any existing files with those names)

## Execution Workflow

After the commit messages are generated and saved, you can review and execute the commit by simply providing:

```
execute prompts/commit-make.sh
```

This will:
- Display the proposed commit messages
- Show current git status
- Prompt you to confirm or abort the commit
- Execute `git add .` and `git commit` if you choose to proceed

## Examples
Good short message for this comprehensive scope:
```
feat: enhance prompts and emphasize GUI difftool backend
```
